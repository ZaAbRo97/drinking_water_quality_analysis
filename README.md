## Drinking Water Quality analysis in Germany

### Description:
#### This project presents a comprehensive time-series analysis of drinking water quality across various physicochemical parameters from August to 1st week of November 2016. It aims to identify abnormal trends, anomalies, and operational insights based on the observed data patterns.

### Dataset
#### Dataset  of the 'Internet of Things: Online Anomaly Detection for Drinking Water Quality' competition hosted at The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO) July 15th-19th 2018, Kyoto, Japan.
The dataset was provided by: Th√ºringer Fernwasserversorgung and IMProvT research project

### Analysis Summary
#### The analysis was conducted by examining monthly trends across seven parameters: temperature, pH, turbidity, chlorine dioxide levels, electric conductivity, redox potential, and flow rate from two water lines. Each graph was reviewed to detect drops, spikes, irregular patterns, and periodical behaviors. Anomalies were correlated across metrics to interpret potential operational events or sensor malfunctions.

### Python Libraries
#### List of Python libraries required: pandas, matplotlib
